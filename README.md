## Build a patch

**The goal of the patch is to change the text in `text.txt`**

### Client

```CSHARP
FPatch.Core fpatch = new FPatch.Core("<PATCH AUTHOR>", "<PATCH VERSION>");
```

- (string) PATCH AUTHOR: your username
- (string) PATCH VERSION: to know wich version will be used as patch

##### Example

```CSHARP
FPatch.Core fpatch = new FPatch.Core("neo", "1.0.0");
```

### Patch

```CSHARP
fpatch.create_and_add("<FILE TO PATCH>", "<OFFSET>", "<BYTES EDITED>");
```
The function `fpatch.create_and_add()` creates a patch and add it to the list of the patches to add for your mod
This is just a simple `fpatch.create()` with a `fpatch.add()`.
If you want to create a patch without adding it to the patch list just use `fpatch.create()` but remember that your `patch.fpp` will contains only the patches added to the list

- (string) FILE TO PATCH: the file path to patch
- (Uint32) OFFSET: the index where the patch will start
- (UInt32[]) BYTES EDITED: the patch


##### Example

```CSHARP
fpatch.create_and_add("test.txt", 0x00000008, new UInt32[]
{
    (UInt32)'N',
    (UInt32)'O',
    (UInt32)'T',
    (UInt32)' ',
    (UInt32)'A',
    (UInt32)' ',
    (UInt32)'T',
    (UInt32)'E',
    (UInt32)'S',
    (UInt32)'T'
});
```

### Entire payload build

`fpatch.apply();` apply all the patches added in the list
```CSHARP
fpatch.apply();
```

The function `fpatch.save()` saves all the patches added to teh list in json, the output is `patch.fpp`

```CSHARP
fpatch.save();
```

```CSHARP
FPatch.Core fpatch = new FPatch.Core("neo", "1.0.0");

fpatch.create_and_add("test.txt", 0x00000008, new UInt32[]
{
    (UInt32)'N',
    (UInt32)'O',
    (UInt32)'T',
    (UInt32)' ',
    (UInt32)'A',
    (UInt32)' ',
    (UInt32)'T',
    (UInt32)'E',
    (UInt32)'S',
    (UInt32)'T'
});

fpatch.apply();
fpatch.save();
```
